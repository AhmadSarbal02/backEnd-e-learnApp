## Backend Code
The backend is developed using PHP and MySQL to handle API requests and database operations efficiently. Key functionalities include:
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and session management.
- **Database Management**: CRUD operations for courses, categories, users, and videos.
- **RESTful API**: JSON-based API endpoints for seamless communication with the frontend.
- **File Handling**: Upload and manage video files for courses.
- **Security Measures**: Input validation, hashed passwords, and protection against SQL injections.
